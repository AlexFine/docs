At Fun.xyz, compliance is a cornerstone of our operations. We have meticulously designed our routing engine & infrastructure more generally to function as an entirely non-custodial protocol, maintained and operated by decentralized actors. Hereâ€™s how we ensure compliance:

- **Non-Custodial Protocol:** The routing engine is designed as a non-custodial protocol. This means that at no point does Fun.xyz take custody of user funds. Fun.xyz is never in flow of funds. Instead, users maintain control over their assets throughout the entire process.

- **Decentralized Operation:** Our protocol can be maintained and operated by decentralized actors, ensuring that there is no central point of control or failure. This decentralized nature aligns with the principles of web3 and enhances security and compliance.

- **User-Controlled Transactions:** From a compliance perspective, using Fun.xyz is equivalent to a user depositing funds into a non-custodial account and then signing a transaction to execute a transfer on their own volition. This approach ensures that users have complete control over their transactions, adhering to the highest standards of financial compliance.

- **Regulatory Alignment:** By ensuring that all transactions are user-initiated and non-custodial, we align with regulatory requirements and best practices. This setup minimizes the risks associated with custody and centralization, providing users with a secure and compliant platform for their web3 activities.

At Fun.xyz, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of compliance while providing a seamless and efficient user experience. Our non-custodial routing engine ensures that users can confidently manage their assets within a compliant and secure framework.
