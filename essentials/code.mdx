<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or
  higher).
</Info>

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Startup
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing)
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the CLI.

<AccordionGroup>

    Update to Node v18. Run `mintlify install` and try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No such file or directory on Windows">

**DEX Example:** You have a DEX on an L2. Your user wants to swap for DEGEN on Base, however, they don't hold ETH on Base. As opposed to showing insufficient balance, your user can complete the swap with any token in their wallet, a credit card, or any funds in their CEX.


### Inline Code

### Code Block

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks and follow the leading ticks with the programming language of your snippet to get syntax highlighting. Optionally, you can also write the name of your code after the programming language.

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
