## Philosophy

In web3, there's a common design pattern involving source assets and target assets or actions. Here's how it works:

- **Swapping**: You need a source asset to get a target asset. Example: Swap ETH (source) for DEGEN (target).
- **Depositing in Perp Exchanges**: You need a source asset for a target action. Example: Deposit USDC.e (source) into a perp exchange smart contract (target action).
- **Staking**: You need a source asset to get a target asset. Example: Stake ETH (source) to get stETH (target).

This process can be a hassle for users because they often don't own the right source asset.

**Example Scenario:**
Imagine a user wants to deposit $1,000 into a high-yield weETH-USDC LP pool on Linea. But their money is in USDT on Mainnet. They would need to:

1. Swap USDT for ETH.
2. Bridge ETH to Linea.
3. Stake ETH for eETH.
4. Wrap their eETH.
5. Swap leftover ETH for USDC.
6. Finally, deposit both tokens into the pool.

And if they have funds in a bank account, they must:

1. Set up a Coinbase account.
2. Deposit money and wait eight days.
3. Create a wallet and whitelist it.
4. Transfer funds to the wallet.

**Our Vision:**
We believe users shouldn't worry about routing and blockchain complexities. Users should only focus on their desired action. Users should be able to leverage any funds to execute their desired action.

**With Checkout:**
The same action can be completed instantly. Here's how:

1. The user enters $1,000 on your UI and clicks *Checkout*.
2. The user selects the debit card option.
3. The LP tokens are instantly deposited into their wallet.

Checkout aims to introduce a new design paradigm â€“ the Checkout paradigm.
